## What's New (User Facing)
 * Bug Fixes: Fixed the incompatibility of the inventory management system, added donation and order creation systems.
 * Improved UI Design: Enhanced the visual design and textual content of homepages, added stylesheets for the add donation page and create order page.
 * Added automatic item status update and integration of inventory and donation data.


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint, our team focused heavily on testing the application. Throughout this process, I personally identified several bugs and developed plans to address them. My team members played a crucial role in fixing these bugs and making significant improvements in data management. In addition, I made some updates to the design to enhance visual experience.

## Unfinished Work
Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were unable to complete the additional features that we had initially planned as optional tasks for this sprint. These features will be considered for future development cycles.

## Retrospective Summary
In this sprint, we dedicated a substantial amount of effort to testing the application and resolving bugs to ensure that all functionalities are working correctly. This being the last sprint, we faced some time limitations that prevented us from implementing all the innovative ideas we had. However, we hope to incorporate these improvements in future updates.

Here's what went well:
  * Completed most of the vital implementations of the management system for the application.
  * Tested and ensured that all the implemented functionalities work well.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Quality of the application.
   * Usability, reliability, efficiency, and convenience of the application.
   * Security of operations, data, and access.

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Data Graphs: Develop statistical graphs to visualize data trends and tendencies for better insights and decision-making.
   * Communication: Implement communication features to facilitate interaction between donors and recipients.
   * Notifications: Add notification functionality to alert users about new donations, orders, and messages.
   * Identity Verification: To utilize the features or operate the system, users must be verified as food bank staff and granted appropriate permissions. User roles include Donor, Staff, and Recipient.
   * Data Generating Page: Allow users to select desired items and export them as a file for reporting or analysis purposes.
