# Sprint 3 Report (6/29/24 - 7/26/2024)

## What's New (User Facing)
* Bug Fixes: We have resolved various issues that were causing incompatibility within the inventory management system. Additionally, we have successfully integrated new features for adding donations and creating orders.
* Improved UI Design: Our team has enhanced the visual appeal and readability of the homepages. We also added new stylesheets for the add donation and create order pages to improve the overall user experience.
* Automatic Item Status Updates: We implemented an automatic status update feature for items, which now seamlessly integrates inventory and donation data for more efficient management.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint, our team focused heavily on testing the application. Throughout this process, I personally identified several bugs and developed plans to address them. My team members played a crucial role in fixing these bugs and making significant improvements in data management. In addition, I made some updates to the design to enhance visual experience.

## Unfinished Work
Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were unable to complete the additional features that we had initially planned as optional tasks for this sprint. These features will be considered for future development cycles.

## Retrospective Summary
In this sprint, we dedicated a substantial amount of effort to testing the application and resolving bugs to ensure that all functionalities are working correctly. This being the last sprint, we faced some time limitations that prevented us from implementing all the innovative ideas we had. However, we hope to incorporate these improvements in future updates.

Here's what went well:
* We successfully completed most of the critical implementations required for the management system.
* We thoroughly tested the application to ensure that all implemented functionalities are working as intended.

Here's what we'd like to improve:
* We aim to further enhance the overall quality of the application.
* We plan to improve the usability, reliability, efficiency, and convenience of the system.
* We intend to strengthen the security measures to protect operations, data, and access.

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* Data Graphs: We plan to develop statistical graphs to visualize data trends and provide better insights for decision-making.
* Communication Features: We aim to implement features that facilitate communication between donors and recipients.
* Notifications: We will add a notification system to alert users about new donations, orders, and messages.
* Identity Verification: Users will need to be verified as food bank staff and granted appropriate permissions to utilize the system's features. User roles will include Donor, Staff, and Recipient.
* Data Generating Page: We will enable users to select and export desired items as a file for reporting or analysis purposes.
